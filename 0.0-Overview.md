# Power BI Comprehensive Notes for Interviews

## **1. What is Power BI?**
- **Definition:** Power BI is an end-to-end business intelligence suite used for analyzing, visualizing, and sharing data insights.
- **Purpose:** Helps organizations make data-driven decisions by presenting complex datasets in an understandable and actionable manner.
- **Core Components:**
  - **Power BI Desktop:** The development tool where data modeling and visualizations are created.
  - **Power BI Service:** A cloud-based platform for publishing, sharing, and collaborating on reports.
  - **Power BI Report Builder:** Used for paginated reports (like invoices).
  - **Power BI Embedded:** Embedding Power BI reports into web applications.
  - **Power BI Mobile App:** On-the-go access to dashboards and reports.

---

## **2. Power BI Architecture**
- **Flow:**
  1. Data Sources (Excel, SQL, APIs, etc.).
  2. Data Transformation (Power Query).
  3. Data Modeling (Define relationships, create calculations using DAX).
  4. Data Visualizations (Reports and dashboards in Power BI Desktop).
  5. Publishing & Collaboration (Power BI Service).

- **Two Modes of Data Interaction:**
  - **Import Mode:** Data is imported into Power BI, stored in-memory for fast performance.
  - **DirectQuery Mode:** Data remains in the source system; queries are sent in real time.
  - **Live Connection:** Direct, real-time connection to specific sources like SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services).

---

## **3. Data Sources in Power BI**
- **Supported Formats:** Excel, CSV, JSON, databases (SQL, Oracle, SAP, etc.), SharePoint, APIs, and online services like Google Analytics.
- **Web Data Sources:** Power BI can scrape structured tables from web pages.
- **Real-Time Data Sources:**
  - Use **Azure Stream Analytics** for real-time data integration.
  - **Example Use Case:** Real-time monitoring of IoT sensors or stock prices.

---

## **4. Power Query (ETL Process)**
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Power Query is the engine for cleaning, reshaping, and transforming data.
- **Common Transformations:**
  - Remove duplicates, nulls, and errors.
  - **Split Columns:** Split data based on delimiters.
  - Pivot/Unpivot tables for reshaping datasets.
  - Merging (combine datasets by keys) and appending (stack datasets).
  - Adding calculated columns for preprocessing.
- **M Code:** Power Query uses a language called **M** for advanced transformations.
  - Example: `Text.Proper("power bi")` → Converts text to proper case.

---

## **5. Data Modeling**
- **Relationships:**
  - Define how tables connect (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
  - Relationships enforce filters and interactions across tables.
- **Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema:**
  - **Star Schema:** Preferred in Power BI for better performance; a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables.
  - **Snowflake Schema:** Normalized data structure; dimension tables are split into multiple related tables.
- **Calculated Columns vs. Measures:**
  - **Calculated Columns:** Row-by-row calculations (stored in the table).
  - **Measures:** Aggregations defined in the context of visuals (optimized for performance).
- **Hierarchies:** Create drill-downs like Year → Quarter → Month → Day.

---

## **6. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Purpose:** A functional language used to create custom calculations and aggregations in Power BI.
- **Common Categories of DAX Functions:**
  - **Aggregations:** `SUM()`, `AVERAGE()`, `COUNT()`.
  - **Logical:** `IF()`, `SWITCH()`.
  - **Filter Context:** `CALCULATE()`, `FILTER()`, `ALL()`.
  - **Time Intelligence:** `TOTALYTD()`, `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR()`.
  - **Text Functions:** `CONCATENATE()`, `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Row Context:** Applies calculations row by row.
  - **Filter Context:** Defined by the filters and slicers applied in visuals.
- **Advanced Examples:**
  - Running Total:  
    ```DAX
    RunningTotal = CALCULATE(SUM('Sales'[Amount]), FILTER(ALL('Sales'), 'Sales'[Date] <= MAX('Sales'[Date])))
    ```
  - Year-Over-Year Growth:
    ```DAX
    YOY Growth = ( [ThisYearSales] - [LastYearSales] ) / [LastYearSales]
    ```

---

## **7. Visualizations**
- **Built-in Visuals:** Bar charts, Line graphs, Maps, Treemaps, KPIs, Cards.
- **Custom Visuals:** Import from Microsoft Marketplace (e.g., Bullet Charts, Sankey Diagrams).
- **Advanced Visualization Techniques:**
  - **Conditional Formatting:** Highlight rows or visuals based on values.
  - **Tooltips:** Add contextual details when hovering over visuals.
  - **Drill-Through:** Enable navigation to detailed reports from summary pages.
  - **Bookmarks:** Save views or toggle between storytelling states.

---

## **8. Row-Level Security (RLS)**
- **Purpose:** Restrict access to specific rows of data based on the user’s role.
- **How It Works:** Use DAX filters on roles.
  - Example: `Region = USERNAME()` ensures users only see their assigned regions.
- **Implementation:**
  - Define roles in Power BI Desktop.
  - Publish roles in Power BI Service.

---

## **9. Advanced Power BI Features**
- **Incremental Refresh:** Load only new or updated data during refresh cycles.
- **Composite Models:** Combine Import and DirectQuery modes in the same dataset.
- **Performance Tuning Tips:**
  - Reduce data size using Power Query.
  - Use measures, not calculated columns, for aggregations.
  - Avoid complex visualizations that slow down rendering.

---

## **10. Sharing & Deployment**
- **Sharing Options:**
  - Publish to Power BI Service.
  - Share dashboards directly.
  - Create Power BI Apps for teams.
- **Deployment Pipelines:** Manage staging (Dev → Test → Production).
- **Export Options:** PowerPoint, PDF, Excel.

---

## **11. Real-Time Scenarios**
- **Scenario-Based Questions:** Be prepared to discuss:
  - “How would you build a sales performance dashboard?”
  - “Explain how you would handle a dataset with 1 million rows to ensure optimal performance.”
  - “Describe a situation where you implemented RLS.”

---

**Pro Tip:** Prepare examples where you've applied concepts like DAX, RLS, or complex data transformations. Stay updated on Power BI features via the [Microsoft Power BI Blog](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/).
